name: factory-setup
description: >-
  Set up, explain, or change a Tessl factory on a repository: agents that act
  on events in the repo, such as triaging new tickets, shipping tickets as
  pull requests, answering reviews and fixing checks on those pull requests,
  reviewing code, or running a job on a schedule. Use when someone wants Tessl agents to do work in their
  repo, asks what a factory is or what theirs does, or wants to add to,
  change, or customize it.

# Factory setup

A factory is a set of automations on a repository. Each one is a rule: when
something happens (a ticket is filed, a pull request gets a review, a time of
day arrives), a Tessl agent runs a skill in the cloud and does one job.

Your job is to help the user pick the first automation that is useful to
them, set it up safely, show it working, and then help them see what else
they could add. Fit the factory to how the user works. Do not assume they use
pull requests, Linear, or any other tool until you have checked.

Rules for the whole session:

- Ask about one thing at a time.
- Use plain words. See [Plain words](#plain-words).
- Never put a generated identifier, such as a workspace name that starts with
  `ws-`, in a question or a choice. When there is only one workspace, call it
  "your Tessl workspace".
- Show the [progress timeline](references/progress.md) in the first message
  you send after a stage changes, even if you change stage without asking
  anything, when you stop before setup is finished, and in the recap.
- Change nothing in the repository, the Tessl workspace, or GitHub until the
  user has said yes in step 1, or, when adding to an existing factory, to
  "Is this what you want?" in step 5.
- Use `--workspace <workspace>` only with these Tessl commands:
  `project link`, `project create`, `integrations show`, and `github token`.
  Before a project is linked, the GitHub App checks need it.
- Do not pass it to `tessl doctor` or `tessl install`. `gh` and `git` commands
  do not take it.
- If preflight found more than one organization, pass `--org <org id>` to
  `project link`, `project create`, `environment create`, and `code repo`.
- Give the user a browser link whenever you create or check a Tessl resource
  they may want to look at. Use the `webUrl` or `Web URL:` value the Tessl
  command prints. Never guess a link or link to an API URL. If a command prints
  no link, say where to find the page in the web app instead. Write every link
  as the plain URL, never as markdown link text, so a terminal shows it. See
  [Browser links](references/links.md).

## 1. Orient the user

If the user has already said they want to add an automation to an existing
factory, skip this step. Do not describe what already exists. Say in one line
that new runs use Tessl credits, link to
[Tessl pricing](https://tessl.io/pricing/), and go to step 2.

Before you run anything that changes state, tell the user in a few short
sentences:

1. What a factory is (the paragraph at the top, in your own words).
2. Three or four examples from [the starter automations](references/starters.md)
   that could fit this kind of repository.
3. What setup will create: a Tessl project linked to the repo, one cloud
   environment for the agents, the Tessl App on this repo, a few
   entries in `tessl.json`, and maybe a label. Code Review uses a second
   GitHub App, Tessl Review.
4. That runs use Tessl credits, and link to [Tessl pricing](https://tessl.io/pricing/)
   for current details.
5. That every automation can be turned off by removing it from `tessl.json`.

Then show the [progress timeline](references/progress.md), with every stage to
do, so the user sees the whole path before they agree. Ask: "Do you want to go
ahead?" Stop if they say no.

## 2. Preflight

1. Check that the Tessl CLI is up to date. Run `tessl --version` first. If it
   is obsolete, follow [Check the Tessl CLI](references/cli-version.md) and
   stop. Otherwise run `tessl cli update --dry-run`. If it reports an
   available update, tell the user to run `tessl cli update`, then check which
   CLI the shell runs, as the same reference says. Do not run `tessl update`:
   that updates plugins, not the CLI. If it fails because self-update is
   disabled, the CLI came from winget: follow the same reference. If the
   version check fails for another reason, tell the user to resolve the CLI
   update before continuing.
2. Work from the repository root. Confirm that the folder is a Git repository
   with a GitHub remote. If it is not a Git repository, or has no GitHub remote,
   tell the user that automations run against a GitHub repository. Ask whether
   to point at an existing repository or create one. Stop without changing
   anything until the user chooses.
   Check whether the repository is a fork
   (`gh repo view --json isFork,parent`). If `isFork` is true, say in one line
   that it is a fork of the `parent` repository and that the factory will run
   on the fork, not on the parent, then continue. Never move the user onto a
   fork to get write access, for example from an upstream with read-only
   access to their fork.
3. If there is no `tessl.json`, tell the user to run `tessl init` and stop.
   If the repository is a fork and `tessl.json` already has `actions`,
   `triggers`, or `schedules`, they came from the parent. Before you link or
   create a project, list them in plain words: what starts each one and what
   it does. Say that they start running on the fork once its project exists
   and the file is on the default branch, and that any action naming an
   environment from the parent is refused until an environment with that name
   exists in the user's workspace. Ask whether to keep, change, or remove each
   one, and make that change in step 7.
4. Read `mode` from `tessl.json`. If it is `vendored` and
   `git ls-files .tessl/plugins` lists nothing, the plugins installed here
   would be committed with the setup, often thousands of lines. Tell the user
   in two sentences: managed mode keeps installed plugins out of git, like
   `node_modules`, and every clone and cloud run installs them from
   `tessl.json`; vendored mode commits them. Recommend managed, and ask. If
   they choose managed, set `"mode": "managed"` in `tessl.json` and run
   `tessl install`, which writes the ignore rules. If `AGENTS.md` or
   `CLAUDE.md` links `.tessl/RULES.md`, which a fresh clone lacks until
   `tessl install` runs, add a line before the link saying to run it first.
   If `.tessl/plugins` is already committed, leave the mode as it is unless
   the user asks.
5. Run `git status`. If there are uncommitted changes, say so and ask the user
   to commit them or put them aside before you continue. Do not move or stash
   them yourself.
6. Run `tessl whoami`. If it fails, ask the user to run `tessl login`.
7. Run `tessl project repair --json`. The workspace is
   `linkedProject.workspaceName`, and `webUrl` is the project's browser link.
   If there is no linked project, and step 1 was
   skipped, do not link or create one: tell the user this repository has no
   factory yet and go to step 1. Otherwise run `tessl org list --json`. If it
   lists several organizations, ask which one to use, by name. Then list the
   workspaces with
   `tessl workspace list`. If there is one, use it without asking. If there
   are several, ask which to use. Before you link or create anything, run the
   GitHub App checks from item 9 and `tessl environment view <repo>-factory --json`,
   and [check permissions](references/permissions.md) for what is still to do.
   Then run `tessl project link --workspace <workspace>`, or
   `tessl project create --workspace <workspace>` if no project matches. Then
   run `tessl project repair --json` again. Keep `linkedProject.id` and
   `webUrl` for the rest of the session, and give the user the project link.
8. From `tessl org list --json`, if the organization's `credits.state` is not
   `ok`, tell the user that factory runs will not start until the
   organization has credits, and ask whether to continue.
9. Find the GitHub repo and its default branch
   (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,defaultBranchRef`). Use
   `defaultBranchRef.name` wherever these steps say `<default branch>`. Check
   that the Tessl App can write to it:
   `tessl integrations show github-app-agent --json` and the exit status of
   `tessl github token --repo <owner/repo>`. Run the
   token check with both output streams redirected to `/dev/null`, and use only
   its exit status. Never capture, print, log, or repeat its output because it
   contains a live installation token. If either check fails, give the user a
   link from the integration JSON: `installUrl` when the app is not installed.
   When it is installed on the repository owner's account, give that entry's
   `manageUrl` (the GitHub page where repository access is granted) first,
   then `webUrl`. When no entry is on that account, give `webUrl` and ask them
   to install the app on the owner's account. If there is no link, send them
   to the organization settings, under Integrations, GitHub. Ask them to install the Tessl GitHub
   App there, or, if it is already installed, to grant it access to this
   repository. Say that it asks for read and write access so agents can
   comment, push branches, and open pull requests. Show the timeline with
   "Check your setup" marked `◐` and wait until they say it is done. Then run
   both checks again. If they pass, carry on with step 3. If not, say which
   check still fails and wait again.

## 3. Learn how the user works

Read before you ask:

- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, for rules about branches,
  pull requests, and releases.
- `git log --first-parent -30 <default branch>`. Merge commits mean work
  arrives through pull requests. Plain commits mean people push to the
  default branch.
- `gh pr list --state merged --limit 10` and
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/rules/branches/<default branch>`.
- Where tickets live: open GitHub issues (`gh issue list --limit 5`), or a
  Linear connection (`tessl integrations show linear --json`).
- CI: the files in `.github/workflows/`.
- What a cloud run needs to build and test: package manifests, lockfiles,
  toolchain files, and the install steps in CI.

Tell the user what you found in two or three sentences, for example "You push
straight to main, file GitHub issues, and have no CI." Ask them to correct
it. If the user has already said what they want to add to an existing
factory, skip the first-ticket question and the goal question below.
Otherwise, if there are
no open GitHub issues and either no Linear connection or no open Linear issues,
recommend a small, safe first ticket, such as a README
fix, and say you can file one to show it working once it is live. Otherwise,
ask: "Is there one thing you want Tessl to take off your plate first?" Do not
create an issue until the user picks a test in step 9.
If the repository needs tools or dependencies installed to build or test, tell
the user which ones. Say that Tessl runs `.tessl/cloud-launch-setup.sh` before
every cloud run, and offer to write it to install them safely more than once.
Ask before writing the hook. Do not mention the hook when the repository needs
no setup.

## 4. Show the current factory

Fetch the default branch (`git fetch origin <default branch>`) and read
`tessl.json` from the remote copy
(`git show origin/<default branch>:tessl.json`). The local file can be behind,
for example after a setup pull request merged on GitHub. If the local file
differs, say so. If the fetch fails, say so and stop. If the fetch works but
the default branch has no `tessl.json`, nothing is set up there yet. Find the
`actions`, `triggers`, and `schedules`, and the environments they use
(`tessl environment view <env> --json`). On a fork whose project was created
in this session, entries inherited from the parent are not on yet: describe
them as preflight did, not as automations already running. Check Code Review for this
repository with `tessl code repo view <owner/repo> --json`, and read
`repository.attentionReason` and, under `repository.review`, `enabled`,
`triggerPolicy` (`open-and-command` reviews when a pull request opens,
`every-push` on every push), `publicationMode`, and `autoApproveWhenResolved`.
Tell the user whether Code Review is on, how it publishes, and whether it will
review the setup pull request. It reviews only when `enabled` is true and
`attentionReason` is null; a non-null reason, such as
`installation-suspended` or `missing-permissions`, means the GitHub App cannot
act on the repository, so name the reason. A missing Loop or factory entry
does not mean Code Review is off. If the repository command fails or the
repository is not listed, run
`tessl integrations show github-app-code-review --json`:

- If its `integrations` list is empty, the Tessl Review app is not connected
  to this workspace. Say Code Review is not set up yet, and keep the `webUrl`
  it prints for step 5.
- If the list has an entry, the app is connected but cannot see this
  repository. Say the repository's Code Review state is unknown. Do not say
  Code Review is absent.

If nothing is set up, say so. If you skipped step 1, go back to step 1 now.
Otherwise, go to step 5.

If something is set up, tell the user in plain words which automations are
on, what starts each one, and which skills are their own copies. Give the
project's Loops link: the project `webUrl` from preflight with `/loops`
added. Then
suggest one or two automations from [the starters](references/starters.md)
that fit what they already have and how they work, and say what each would
save them. For example: "Tessl already ships your labeled issues. Code
Review could review every pull request, including the ones your team opens."
If an implement action is set up and no `follow-ticket-changes` action is, suggest adding
"Follow ticket changes" first: without it, runs keep going after a person takes an issue back, pull
requests stay open after their issue ends, and an answered or unblocked issue
waits for a person to move it.
Ask what they want to do: add an automation, remove one, change what starts
one, or [edit a skill](references/customize.md). If they
want to add an automation, go to step 5. Steps 1 to 3 have already run; do not
repeat them. In step 6, reuse the environment the existing actions use,
except for "Improve development", which has its own.

## 5. Pick the first automation

Set up the first automation, with one exception: whenever "ship tickets" is
the starter being set up, offer "answer reviews and fix checks" at the same
time, and Code Review too when step 4 found it not set up or unknown.

- If the user named a goal in step 3, set up the starter that meets it.
- If not, offer two or three starters from [the starters](references/starters.md)
  that fit how they work, each in one sentence, with your recommendation
  first.
- If they push straight to the default branch, do not offer automations that
  need a pull request on every change. Offer the ones that work without pull
  requests, and say that "ship tickets" opens one pull request per ticket.
  "Answer reviews and fix checks" acts only on pull requests Tessl opens, so
  offer it with "ship tickets" even for these users.
- If they want something no starter covers, follow
  [Write your own automation](references/starters.md#write-your-own-automation).

Whenever "ship tickets" is the starter being set up, first say what it does in
plain words: what starts it, what the agent does, what it changes, and how to
stop it. Say that it comes with a small loop, "Follow ticket changes" (the
`follow-ticket-changes` action), that keeps it in step with people: it
cancels runs when a person takes an issue back, closes the pull request when
the issue ends, and wakes the issue when a person answers Tessl's question or
its blocker ends. Then explain that "answer reviews and fix checks" acts only on pull
requests Tessl opens: it answers review comments, fixes failing checks, and says
when the pull request is ready to merge. If step 4 found Code Review not set up
or unknown, also explain "review pull requests": Tessl reviews every pull
request, including the ones Tessl opens, and the agent answering reviews acts
on those findings. Say that it needs the Tessl Review app on the repository,
and that setup turns review on once the factory is live. Recommend all of
them together.
Ask which they want: all of them, "ship tickets" with "answer reviews and fix
checks", or "ship tickets" alone. Set up only what they say yes to. Add the
`tessl.json` entries in one change, follow
[Review pull requests](references/starters.md#review-pull-requests) for Code
Review, and test each chosen part if the user picks a test in step 9.

For every other starter, before you build it, say what it does in the same
plain terms and ask: "Is this what you want?"

## 6. Create the environment

Use one environment named `<repo>-factory`. If it exists, show its access and
ask before you change it. If not, create it with the access that the chosen
starter lists. When both "ship tickets" and "answer reviews and fix checks"
are chosen, use this one environment for both. Both need
`--github-access write`. For Linear, also keep `--linear-access write`,
because the agent answering reviews reads the Linear issue:

`tessl environment create <repo>-factory <flags>`, then confirm it with
`tessl environment view <repo>-factory --json`. Give the user the environment
link from `webUrl`. When you tell the user, show the
timeline with "Build it" now.

"Improve development" uses its own read-only environment, `<repo>-improve`,
as its starter says, so its agents cannot push.

If `tessl environment create --help` has no flag that the starter needs, ask
the user to create the environment in the web app, under workspace settings,
Environments, with that access.

## 7. Write tessl.json

1. Pick where the change goes. Fetch the remote default branch first, and
   start any branch from it, not from a local copy that may be out of date.
   Name the branch `setup-tessl-factory`. If that name already exists locally
   or on the remote, name it after the starter being added:
   `add-tessl-ship-tickets`, `add-tessl-answer-reviews`, or `add-tessl-<name>`
   in lowercase words joined by hyphens for any other starter. If that name
   exists too, add `-2`, `-3`, and so on until the name is free.
   - If the user works through pull requests, create that branch and make
     every file change on it.
   - If the user pushes straight to the default branch, ask whether to commit
     there or use that branch.
2. Check the agent and model of every action you will add. Run
   `tessl launch models --json`: it lists the agent and model pairs cloud runs
   accept in this workspace, and the `default` pair, which is `null` when the
   workspace has none. The list spells `claude` as `claude-code` and `tessl` as
   `tessl-agent`; both spellings work in `tessl.json`. Keep a starter's `agent`
   and `model` only when that pair is in the list. Otherwise ask the user to
   pick a pair from the list. When `default` is not `null`, recommend it, and
   offer to remove `model` so that pair runs. Never name a model that is not in
   the list.
   If the command fails, the list is unknown, not empty: say so, keep the
   starter's pair, and let `tessl doctor --automations` below check it.
3. Add the entries that the chosen starter lists. If both "ship tickets" and
   "answer reviews and fix checks" were chosen, point both actions and the
   follow-ticket-changes action at the same environment and add their
   triggers in this one change. Keep every other key in the file. Actions
   name the published skills; do not add those plugins to `dependencies`.
   Fill in `<user-id>` and `<repo-id>` as
   [the triggers reference](references/triggers.md) says. Tell the user in one
   line who can start them: on GitHub only they can, and how to let someone
   else; on Linear, anyone who can delegate to Tessl.
4. If the user agreed to the setup hook in step 3, add
   `.tessl/cloud-launch-setup.sh` in the same change. It runs from the clone
   root before every cloud run, and its install steps must be safe to run more
   than once. Make every required setup failure stop the hook with a non-zero
   exit, for example by using `set -e` or checking each command's exit status.
   Write it as [the setup hook reference](references/setup-hook.md) says:
   compatible version ranges from the repository's own declarations, not CI's
   exact versions.
5. Check the change in a fresh clone, as a cloud run sees it. Say it may take
   a few minutes, and if there is a hook, name any step in it that changes the
   machine outside the clone (global installs, version managers, Corepack,
   `sudo`) and ask the user's agreement. If they decline, skip the check and
   say the cloud check in step 8 will test the hook.
   - Clone the repository from GitHub (`gh repo clone <owner/repo> <dir>`)
     into a temporary directory, not from the local copy, so the clone's
     origin matches the project. Copy the proposed change into it, and run
     `tessl install` from its root.
   - If there is a hook, run `CI=true bash .tessl/cloud-launch-setup.sh < /dev/null`
     twice, to show it is safe to run more than once, on the user's machine.
     If a hook run fails, show the failing step. Fix the hook only if the
     failure would also happen on the cloud machine, then test again. If it
     comes from a local difference (another OS, a tool the cloud machine has
     and this one lacks), say so and leave that step alone.
   - Run the repository's lint and test commands found in step 3.
   - Delete the copy afterwards. If there is a hook, say the real check is
     the cloud run in step 8, before the merge.
6. If the starter uses a label, create it if it is missing, for example
   `gh label create tessl`.
7. If the starter works on pull requests, check the branch rules from step 3,
   auto-merge, and "dismiss approvals on push". Tell the user how each one
   changes what the automation does. If the default branch requires an
   approving review, also warn that `Comment only` Code Review mode cannot
   satisfy that rule. Tessl can approve only when Code Review is
   enabled with a null `attentionReason` and `publicationMode` is
   `enforcing`. It then approves a pull request whose review has no blocking
   findings, or, with `autoApproveWhenResolved` on, once every Tessl Reviewer
   thread on the pull request is resolved. With auto-approve off, warn that a
   pull request with blocking findings still waits for a human approval. If
   Code Review is off, needing attention, or unknown, say that Tessl pull
   requests will wait for a human approval. If they want Tessl's review to
   satisfy the rule, offer
   `tessl code repo update <owner/repo> --review-publication enforcing`, or
   **Approve or request changes** under **Code reviews** in the web app if
   that is refused. Change nothing without asking.
   When Code Review and "answer reviews and fix checks" are both on or both
   chosen, say what
   the review's `triggerPolicy` means for Tessl's pull requests:
   `open-and-command` reviews a pull request when it opens or when someone
   asks, so a fix the agent pushes after an approval is not reviewed again;
   `every-push` reviews every push, and each review uses credits. Recommend
   `every-push`, and ask. Apply the choice with
   `tessl code repo update <owner/repo> --review-trigger <policy>`. If setup
   is turning review on, apply it in step 8, when review goes on.
8. Run `tessl doctor --automations`. Act only on the Automation Configuration
   section; ignore every other section. Fix problems in that section. Tell the
   user what each warning means for them, not what it says. For example, "event
   delivery not confirmed" means "Tessl has not received a GitHub event from
   this repo yet. This is normal until the change is on the default branch."
   If it reports that a model is not available to an agent in this workspace, run `tessl launch models --json` again and ask the user to pick a listed pair, or to remove `model` when the list has a `default` pair, then run `tessl doctor --automations` again. If it then reports `The workspace organization has no default model configured for cloud-run-solver.`, stop and tell the user that their model provider needs a default for cloud runs or that they can set `model` to a model their provider enables. The local configuration passes when this section reports that `tessl.json` is valid and lists no configuration problems. Do not take the setup live while Agent selections or Event delivery is Undetermined; those online readiness checks must run successfully. Before the change is on the default branch, the Loops subsection reports that the project has not processed a `tessl.json` yet. That is expected, and the delivery lines then warn that nothing runs. When "answer reviews and fix checks" is set up, doctor always reports the `shepherd-checks-failed` and `shepherd-checks-passed` triggers as events that cannot be marked. These Information lines are not problems, and they do not block going live. Tell the user what they mean: runs that start when a check finishes leave no mark on GitHub, so watch them in the Loops tab. If it reports that cloud runs will fail installing a dependency's `file:` source, say in plain words that cloud runs install every dependency in `tessl.json` and will fail on that one, and offer to switch it to the published plugin. If it says the source is not committed, include it in the commit instead. Do not change it without asking.
9. If the repository's own checks fail on files that Tessl installed, such
   as `.tessl/plugins/`, say so: cloud runs fail the same way even when CI
   passes. Ask before you change any lint, format, or CI configuration. Do not
   edit the installed plugin files.
10. Show the user the diff and say in one sentence what each entry does.
    Then show the timeline with "Build it" done and "Go live" now.

## 8. Go live

1. Ask: "Do you want me to push this?" When the change adds or changes the
   setup hook and the user pushes straight to the default branch, say in the
   same question that you will first push it to a temporary branch to check
   the hook in the cloud. If yes, push. If it is on a setup branch, open a
   pull request to the default branch and give the user its link. If the
   change adds or changes the hook, [check it in the
   cloud](references/cloud-check.md) before it reaches the default branch.
   Ask: "May I
   merge this setup pull request?" Merge it only if the
   user agrees. If the user declines, ask them to merge it. If the merge is
   refused, by the agent's permission system or by GitHub, do not retry or work
   around the refusal; ask the user to merge it. The automations start only
   once `tessl.json` is on the default branch.
2. Fetch the default branch and read `tessl.json` from
   `origin/<default branch>`. Proceed only if it is readable and reflects the
   whole submitted change: every added or changed value matches and every
   removed entry is absent. Otherwise, say that the configuration is not live
   and stop. When it passes, say the change is merged and that you are now
   checking that Tessl has turned the automations on. Do not say or suggest
   that the factory is running until step 3 confirms the Loops. Ask whether
   the user wants their local default branch updated. Update it only if they
   agree. If the agent's permission system refuses the update, do not retry or
   work around the refusal; tell the user to run
   `git switch <default branch> && git pull` themselves.
3. Give the user the project's Loops link: the project `webUrl` from
   [Preflight](#2-preflight) with `/loops` added, ending in
   `/go/projects/<project id>/loops`. Say which Loops they
   will see and what starts each. Then
   [confirm the Loops appear](references/confirm-loops.md). Do not say setup is
   finished until they do.
4. When every Loop has appeared: if the user chose "review pull requests"
   and review was not already on, turn it on now, as
   [Review pull requests](references/starters.md#review-pull-requests) says.
   Setup turns it on only after the merge, so the setup pull request is not
   reviewed and the first review lands on Tessl's first pull request. If it
   is refused, the handover says review is not on yet and how the user turns
   it on, and does not list it as on. Then go straight to step 9.

## 9. Hand over and choose what is next

Do this as soon as step 8 confirms the Loops, before any test. First gather
what the message needs: the organization's credits and, when review is on,
`tessl code repo view <owner/repo> --json`. Then, with no tool call in
between, send one message that starts with "Your factory is live.", shows the [progress timeline](references/progress.md) with "Recap"
marked `●` now, and tells the user:

- Which automations are on, what starts each one, and the project's Loops link.
- What is verified so far, that the Loops exist, and what is not: no run has
  happened yet.
- How to stop one: say the "Stop it" line for each automation that is on, from
  [the starters](references/starters.md). Once the change reaches the default
  branch, it prevents new runs; it does not cancel one already in progress.
- The organization's remaining credits, from `credits.remaining` in
  `tessl org list --json`. Do not estimate how many runs are left.
- That they can ask their agent later what the factory has done or why
  something did not happen ([understand-factory](../understand-factory/SKILL.md)),
  or to change or extend it ([change-factory](../change-factory/SKILL.md)).

If the user asks for something before this message has gone out, send it
first in your next reply, then do what they asked.

End that message with one question and three choices:

1. Show it working on an issue: follow [Testing the factory](references/testing.md).
2. Tune the repository so the automations make fewer mistakes. When
   prepare-repo has already run on this repo, because its verifier groups are
   under `verify.groups` in `tessl.json` or its lenses are in
   `.tessl-code-review.yml`, offer the
   [Improve development](references/starters.md#improve-development) starter.
   Otherwise offer the [prepare-repo](../prepare-repo/SKILL.md) skill: it reads
   the repo's review history, CI failures, and fix commits, and proposes agent
   context, checks, and review rules. It changes nothing in the repository
   until the user picks what to keep; a missing skill it needs is installed
   for their account only if they agree. When step 3 found substantial agent
   context, such as a full `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, call it a tune-up of
   what is there.
3. Finish here.

Mark "Recap" done when the user answers, or after the test's report if they
chose a test. A test, however narrowly the user
asks for it ("just label an existing issue"), ends with the short report in
[Testing the factory](references/testing.md#after-the-test); do not ask the
question again. If they want another starter instead, run `git status` as in
step 2, then go back to step 5 for it.
The Tessl project and GitHub App already exist; step 6 reuses the environment,
except for "Improve development", which has its own. Start a new timeline for
that automation, as in
[Adding another automation](references/progress.md#adding-another-automation).

## Plain words

Say the plain words. If a command or screen shows the Tessl term, say what it
means in one line.
